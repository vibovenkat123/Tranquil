# Tranquil

A wellness app that allows you to take notes (coming soon), journal, meditate, 
and add daily tasks.

# Why?

The reason I built this was because I was searching for new tools, and most of
them were too complex and too much for my needs. Tranquil is really simple and
fits all my needs.



# What I used

This project is almost all frontend

* Figma
* Next.js
* Typescript
* Shadcn UI


# Why is there no database?

In order to seamlessly export data, I used localStorage. It allows for quick
exporting and importing. LocalStorage is also only stored on the users device,
so their private data is not stored on someone elses server

# What next?
